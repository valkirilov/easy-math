Easy-math is a small simple game that challenges you to solve simple math problems for a given ammount of time.
This project is build with the best Superheroic JavaScript MVW Framework  (for me at this momment) [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) and of course scaffolded with [Bootsrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

Just for fun
=========
This game is made to entertain the people please don't kill the joy. 
If you think that you are a good hacker and you can make your score the best, 
the bad news are that this is not the field where you can demonstrate your abilities.
