<h3 class="text-left">About Easy-math</h3>
<p class="text-left">
    Easy-math is a small simple game that challenges you to solve simple math problems for a given ammount of time.
    <br />
    This project is build with the best Superheroic JavaScript MVW Framework  (for me at this momment) 
    <a href="http://angularjs.org" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> and of course scaffolded with 
    <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootsrap</a>.
</p>

<h3 class="text-left">Just for fun <span class="label label-warning">For the hackers!</span></h3>
<p class="text-left">
    This game is made to entertain the people please don't kill the joy. <br />
    If you think that you are a good hacker and you can make your score the best, 
    the bad news are that this is not the field where you can demonstrate your abilities. <br />
